will need to install the following:

firebase
firebase_admin
numpy
pandas
flask-cors
flask
git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git
pillow
torch
requests
beautifulsoup4
selenium

Because we're broke college students, we wont be hosting the flask app on a server 
(especially if we include live webscraping - which would quickly add up costs)

So instead, do the following steps: 
1. run application.py (which holds our flask file)

2. run home.html or index.html to get started

3. go through the pages as the instructions tell you to

note: we currently only have aritzia button working using pickled files that are stored locally
This may/can be eventually replaced with webscraping

Use console / firebase / local env to debug the program
